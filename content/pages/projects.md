_Project Purpose_: To examine the policies, procedures, and behaviors that impact biohazardous waste disposal in research laboratories on MIT campus and identify best practices for laboratories to reduce their environmental footprint. 

**Advice**

Make it fun and informative (don't feel you need to be constrained by traditional academic posters). Stay away from text heavy posters.

A few links of inspiration:

**Past Projects Include**

- Integrated Waste Management System Design for the Kuna Yala Islands in Panama; students worked on waste flow assessment and the design and implementation of local businesses.
- Design of a Regional Recycling Facility for the Luz del Futuro Waste Pickers association in Bluefields, Nicaragua; students designed collection routes and local technologies offering substantial increases in profit.
