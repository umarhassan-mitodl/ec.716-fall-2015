## COURSE OVERVIEW

This page focuses on the course *EC.716 D-Lab: Waste* as it was taught by Kate Mytty and Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar in Fall 2015.

This course provides a multidisciplinary approach to managing waste in low- and middle-income countries. The course focuses on understanding some of the multiple dimensions of waste generation and management. Topics are presented in real contexts, through case studies, field trips, labs, civic engagement, and research. Topics include consumer culture, waste streams, waste management, entrepreneurship and innovation on waste, technology evaluation, downcycling/upcycling, Life Cycle Analysis, and waste assessment.

## INSTRUCTOR INTERVIEW

> Material flows are a major influence on the way we live our day-to-day lives and on the types of things we consume. The purpose of this class was to help students become more cognizant of the types of systems, technologies, and actors that exist within those flows.
