There are three writing assignments throughout the semester. Each paper should be 4â€“5 pages in length. In addition, students will give one presentation on one of their papers. These presentations are meant to present a detailed version of the paper on the same topic. Each presentation will be 20 minutes in length, with 10 minutes for Q&A.

You will be evaluated on the depth of your presentation, synthesis of material, integration of class content and clarity of thought. Bonus points will be awarded for innovative presentation styles.
