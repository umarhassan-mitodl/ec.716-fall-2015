Third Reflection

**Subject: Waste Management Partnership / Enterprise / Actor**

The third paper is a chance to select either a:

*   Specific actor (for example: Waste Management, Save that Stuff, Wecyclers, Sanergy, Enevo, etc.)
*   Specific partnership (for example: Casella and the City of Cambridge)

Include
-------

*   Introduce the actor or partnership (history, competition, business model, size (revenue and employees), any trends in their size)
*   Discuss their role in the waste management system
    *   Who are their partners
    *   Where do they work
    *   What is their comparative advantage
    *   Who are their competitors
    *   What role do they serve in the waste management system (for example: Collection, transportation, etc.)
    *   What types of materials do they handle and how much per year
    *   Has there been any press (positive or negative) on their work
    *   Is anything from these models transferable to developing settings? How would that work?
*   Analyze their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (a SWOT model)
*   End with your conclusions about the actor or partnership
    *   Do you see this as a lasting model?
